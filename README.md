# Convert Modernist Theme to static blog

[Demo the Theme](http://megakote.github.com/modernist)

Some modified version of the *modernist* theme for my static blog.

# SCSS

This project still uses SCSS for it's CSS. If you want to contribute, please make your changes to the .scss files in the /sass directory. If you're unfamiliar with SCSS, here's [an excellent article to get you started](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getting-started-with-sass/). I recommend using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com)

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
