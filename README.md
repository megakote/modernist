# Convert Modernist Theme to static blog

[Demo](http://megakote.github.com/modernist)

Some modified version of the *modernist* theme for my static blog.

# SCSS

This project still uses SCSS/Compass. If you're unfamiliar with SCSS/Compass, here's [an excellent article to get you started](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getting-started-with-sass/) or [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/) or [compass-style.org](http://compass-style.org/).

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
